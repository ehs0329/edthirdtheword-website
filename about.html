        <p>My name is Edward Springer. I have a Bachelor's of Science in
            Computer Science from Rowan University. Programming is my passion,
            and I look forward to a long and prosperous career in my field. If
            you are interested in my work, feel free to <a
                href="contact.html">contact</a> me with any opportunities for
            which you believe I will be fit</p>
        <p>The language I am most familiar with is Java, simply because it is
            the primary language I was taught at Rowan. However, I have a firm
            grasp of the concepts of programming languages and can learn new
            languages rather quickly.</p>
        <p>Windows was the first OS I ever used, and up until recently, it was
            still my OS of choice, but I now prefer Linux. Although I still
            maintain a Windows 10 partition on my personal computer, it is used
            almost exclusively for computer gaming.  Whenever I want to
            actually get work done, I boot into my Arch Linux partition. The
            nginx webserver you are currently viewing this site on is also
            running Arch Linux and was configured entirely through SSH on the
            command line.</p>
