        <p>My name is Edward H. Springer III. I graduated from Rowan University
            with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. Programming is my
            passion, and I look forward to a long and prosperous career in my
            field. If you are interested in my work, feel free to
            <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me with any opportunities for
            which you believe I will be fit</p>
        <p>The language I am most comfortable with is Java, simply bcause it is
            the primary language I was taught at Rowan. However, I have a firm
            grasp of the concepts of programming languages and therefore learn
            new languages with little effort.</p>
        <p>Windows was the first OS I ever used, and up until recently, it was
            still my OS of choice, but I have come to love Linux. Although I
            still maintain a Windows 10 partition on my personal computer, it
            is used almost exclusively for computer gaming at this point.
            Whenever I wish to actually get work done, I boot into my Arch
            Linux partition. The nginx webserver you are currently viewing this
            site on is also running Arch Linux and was configured purely through
            SSH on the command line.</p>
