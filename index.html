        <p>If you see this page, my nginx web server is successfully installed
            and working. Further configuration is required.</p>
        <p>I will be adding much more to this site in the future. My plan is to
            use it to showcase the projects that I have worked on and progress
            for current projects. Any available sources, including this website,
            will be on my <a href="http://github.com/ehs0329">github page</a>.</p>
        <p>For a basic list of planned site features, you may refer to
            <a href="plans.html">future plans</a>.</p>
