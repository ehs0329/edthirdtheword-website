<h1>Welcome to edthirdtheword.com!</h1>
<p>If you see this page, my nginx web server is successfully installed and
working. Further configuration is required.</p>

<p>I will be adding much more to this site in the future. My plan is to use
it to showcase the projects that I have worked on and progress for current
projects. Any available sources, including this website, will be on my
<a href="http://github.com/ehs0329">github page</a>.</p>

<p>For a basic list of planned site features, you may refer to
<a href="plans.php">future plans</a>.</p>
